This project contains scripts and compiled components used for generating lattice structures in Grasshopper, in line with the methods described in [Scalable, process-oriented beam lattices: Generation, characterization, and compensation for open cellular structures](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2021.102386).

The code in this repository was developed in pursuit of the author's degree at the University of Delaware. The contents herein do not express the positions of the aforementioned organization(s), institution(s), or funding source(s) of the author's formal activites.
